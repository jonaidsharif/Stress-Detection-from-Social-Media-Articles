I\\u2019ve been battling with chronic stress for about 3 weeks now. I want to say the cause of it is my job. It\\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. Due to the pandemic, I\\u2019ve had 4 different positions within the past 3 months. My regular position that I held before this all this happened was awesome. I actually loved my job and looked forward to work each morning. When everything shut down back in March, until about the middle of May, I was moved to two other positions that we still pretty relaxed, the hours just kind of sucked. But now this new role that I\\u2019ve been in for about a month is killing me. It\\u2019s very stressful, the days are long, it seems like a constant race against the clock, the people I deal with can be a pain which adds more stress. I keep telling myself it\\u2019s only temporary and hopefully I\\u2019ll be able to get my old job as things start to normalize more. But for the past 3 weeks my symptoms have included Weighted chest (most prominent symptom) Lightheadedness/Dizziness Tightness in neck and shoulders Lower back pain Anxiety that won\\u2019t go away Rapid heartbeat Acid reflux/heartburn Stomach issues Fatigue I have tired to change my diet to start eating a bit healthier. I\\u2019ve also been trying breathing exercises and doing stretching in the evenings when I get home from work. It seems to help a little. I also plan on getting back to the gym, because I know exercise will help out as well. I\\u2019m just wondering if this is something that will eventually go away or am I in it for the long haul? I\\u2019ve felt this way once before, about a month before my daughter was born. But it completely went away right after she was born. Not kidding. Maybe big life changes are my trigger? But I didn\\u2019t feel this way when I got married or bought a house or anything like that. Any insight or advice to manage this is greatly appreciated!!\",\n          \"We only see those who get better Aka survivorship bias. We hear the stories of the people whose mental illness got better, but there\\u2019s little acknowledgement of those who have only gone downhill. I\\u2019m tired of hearing \\u201cIt will get better, just look at what happened to me!\\u201d Because it hasn\\u2019t. Why should I continue suffering for the lofty hope that my depression will ease up? I call it as I see it. If my mental state has deteriorated, even after years of treatment, then I probably won\\u2019t end up as a survivor.\",\n          \"I miss the old me I\\u2019ve forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like. I\\u2019ve forgotten what it\\u2019s like to actually have a passion for life. These last few months have been a blur, I can only really recall a few days in detail. I miss the old me, she had so much potential. She had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy and prettier. Now I can\\u2019t even move out of bed. I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I\\u2019ve pushed them away. I don\\u2019t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don\\u2019t even notice when I don\\u2019t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive. Every single thing overwhelms me-the cat wouldn\\u2019t eat the food I gave him today because he\\u2019s so fussy and I just burst into tears. I\\u2019m so tired. I want out. Everything used to be so different. EDIT I never expected this post to blow up so much and I\\u2019m overwhelmed by the response rate and kind messages. I\\u2019m a bit too overwhelmed to reply just yet, but I will soon, know I\\u2019m appreciative of every single pm and comment.
